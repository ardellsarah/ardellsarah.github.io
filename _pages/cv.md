Work experience
======
**Kryazhimskiy Lab – University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA**  
*PhD Student*                                        
- Predicting how mutational effects change across strains and environments
  - Led a project to elucidate how the effects of 100 mutations change across 42 strains and 6 different environments.
  - Created a model to effectively predict how the effects of mutational change between strains and environments by reducing a >10,000 parameter system to one with a single, measurable parameter per environment.
  -	Developed a flexible computational pipeline to produce robust estimates of mutational effects including tune-able parameters, statistical methods for outlier exclusion, quality checks, and corrections for measurement error.
  -	Conducted all NGS analyses, statistical modelling, and computational modelling. 
 
- Developing evolution-informed strategies for combination antibiotic therapy 
  -	Created novel conceptual and analytical frameworks to model whether any antibiotic drug pair is likely to promote multi-drug resistance.
  -	Developed a concise, measurable metric for prioritizing optimal treatment strategies after resistance has emerged. 
  -	Led and was awarded the UCSD Founding Faculty Award and publicized for broader audiences in the eLife Digest for my first-author publication. 

- Consequences of genomic modularity (mentorship)
  -	Mentored an undergraduate student through a project employing computational and analytical modelling to study how modularity in the genome biases adaptation toward maladapted loci. 
  -	Fostered independence and confidence in my mentee, resulting in his presentation of a poster at a large conference, preparation of a manuscript for publication, and acceptance into USC’s computational biology PhD program.

 **Nucleate Activator Eco**  
 *Director of Education 	2023-Present*
-	Directed curriculum development for the global Nucleate Activator program which educates academic trainees on entrepreneurship and helps them launch bio-technology startups in food, agriculture and biomanufacturing spaces.  

 *Head of Communications  2022-2023*                                                         
-	Organized a cross-country team of 8 to recruit industry experts for 10 workshops. 
-	Communicated and enforced goals for 13 nationally distributed teams working to launch startups.

 **California Ecology and Conservation Field Biology Course**  
 *Course Assistant 2019*
-	Guided and inspired 30 students from across all UC campuses in an intensive 8-week field biology course.
-	Provided oversight on experimental design, conduction of experiments, and data analysis for 12 independent projects spanning 3 natural reserves across the state of California.  

 **University of California, San Diego**	  
 *Teaching Assistant 2017-2021*
-	Served for 7 different courses, ranging from Academic Writing to Computational Modelling of Evolution. 
-	Received 100% positive recommendations from more than 100 submitted student evaluations.
-	Student feedback consistently praises my: ability to explain complex concepts in accessible ways, engaging positive attitude, and investment my student’s success.

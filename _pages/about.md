I am a PhD candidate at UC San Diego's Biological Sciences Program with a dual focus in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution and Quantitiative Biology. I am in the lab of [Dr. Sergey Kryazhimskiy]( https://www.sklab.science), where we strive to collect the data and build the models that will make microbial evolution predictable. I am broadly interested in marrying computational, analytical and statistical modelling with massive empirical data sets to uncover the overarching patterns and constraints that might make microbial evolution predictable. My thesis specifically revolves around creating novel mathematical and computational frameworks to predict evolution in variable environments. During my PhD, I have also served as a leader, currently as the Director of Education, for [Nucleate Eco](https://nucleate.xyz), a global educational program for academic trainees working to translate their eco-technology innovations into companies. In this role, I am constantly inspired by the potential for biology to provide solutions to today's most pressing environmental and global health challenges. 

In my free time, I love to backpack, climb, and hang out with my cat Kittums McGittums!

I am a PhD candidate in UC San Diego's Biological Sciences Program with a dual focus in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution and Quantitiative Biology. I am advised by [Dr. Sergey Kryazhimskiy]( https://www.sklab.science). I am broadly interested in uncovering the overarching patterns and genetic constraints that might make microbial evolution predictable. My thesis specifically revolves around creating novel mathematical and computational frameworks, parameterized with massive NGS data sets, to predict evolution in variable environments.   

During my PhD, I have also served as a leader, currently as the Director of Education, for [Nucleate Eco](https://nucleate.xyz), a global educational program for academic trainees working to translate their bio-technology innovations in the food, agriculture, and biomanufacturing spaces into companies. In this role, I am constantly inspired by the potential for biology to provide solutions to today's most pressing environmental and global health challenges. 

In my free time, I love to backpack, climb, and hang out with my cat Kittums McGittums!

Overview
======

My work consists of the necessary first steps toward predicting how microbes will respond to variable environments, a goal which, if completed, would have far reaching impacts from the field of public health to the field of conservation biology. 
Sometimes, such as when designing a multi-antibiotic treatment regime, we would like to be confident that a chosen perturbation to a microbial population's environment will effectively eliminate the population. Other times, as when assisting population’s gene flow across fragmented landscapes, we would like to be confident that the perturbation instead assists the population’s survival. However, it is often very difficult to know how an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce (e.g., “fitness”) will quantitatively change in the face of perturbations until after the perturbation is done. This ‘blind’ approach to treatment and conservation regimes can have substantial negative consequences, including the perpetuation of multi-drug antibiotic resistance or the local extinction of populations which offer ecosystem services.  If, instead, we were able to uncover rules and patterns that govern how an organism’s fitness changes across environments, we would be able to a priori design treatment or conservation regimes which would optimally steer populations in the evolutionary direction which best aides our health and/or environment. Uncovering these fundamental rules and patterns is the focus of my thesis work. 
 Throughout my chapters, I develop and utilize the concept of the “JDFE” (or, Joint Distribution of Fitness Effects”). The JDFE is a measurable property of the local fitness landscape. Specifically, the JDFE maps how the fitness effects of mutations in an organism’s main ‘home’ environment will change with a given environmental perturbation (e.g., fitness in the ‘non-home’ environment). I demonstrate the utility of the JDFE in predicting both whether a perturbation will, on average, increase or decrease in fitness when its environment changes and how variable we can expect the response to be. 


Developing evolution-informed multi-antibiotic treatments
------
In this computational and analytical project, I formalize the definition of the JDFE, produce analytical predictions of non-home fitness trajectories given a JDFE, and demonstrate the potential utility of the JDFE in developing multi-antibiotic treatments to best avoid the emergence of multi-drug resistance. Check out our [paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/73250), published in eLife in 2021, as well as the [Rshiny application](https://smardell.shinyapps.io/rshiny_jdfe/) I developed to interact with the results .

Predicting how the effects of mutations changes across strains and environments 
------
In this project, I analyze a large experimental data set of JDFEs which measure the fitness effects of ~ 100 mutations in 6 different environments (2 temperatures and 3 pH’s) in 42 different strains of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using these data, I discover remarkable consistency in how the effects of mutations change across strains and environments. This work suggests that the evolution of microbial populations in variable environments may indeed be possible to predict.

The consequences of genomic modularity (Mentorship)
------
A project employing computational and analytical modelling to study how modularity in the genome biases adaptation toward maladapted loci, led by previous undergrad research assistant Mark Kim - now a PhD student in USC's computational biology PhD program.

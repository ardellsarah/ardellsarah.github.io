Aberrant afferent signaling drives adverse remodeling of the cardiac nervous system in ischemic heart disease. This study determined that thoracic spinal column stimulation (SCS) obtunds the capacity of dorsal root ganglia ventricular afferent neurons to transduce the ischemic myocardium to second-order spinal neurons, a mechanism that would blunt reflex sympathoexcitation to myocardial ischemic stress. This modulation does not reflect antidromic actions of SCS but likely reflects efferent-mediated changes at the myocyte-sensory neurite interface.
